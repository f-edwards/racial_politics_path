explore model fit under alternate specifications. look at bivars and functional relationships b/w outcomes and focal predictors

describe prior selection


```{r}
## Diagnostics for model fit
# focus on zero inflated processes
# and parsimony / convergence trade offs
# using default brms priors for ease
# log(children) not improving teacher fit. leaving it out

# From IPUMS
# User Note: The Census Bureau did not collect information on the type of group quarters in the 1910 census. 
# This is reflected in the 1910 complete count file, where all group-quarters units have been assigned a GQ code of 4 (other group quarters). 
# Values for GQ, GQTYPE, and GQFUNDS in the 1910 1% and 1.4% samples have been imputed.

### stability in boarding_schools - increase in acres distributed, not much to model other than average
### only action is decrease in time series at end, so that's a bit funky

ggplot(bs_mdat %>% 
         filter(boarding_schools>0,
                morill_acres_cum>0),

### similar look here. some increases in bs pops, e.g. in SD, AZ, OK, but mostly stable over the period
### some clear increases and maybe log-linear things going on, but don't want to overfit.

#### OK - zero inflation is way to go, but there's no 1900 - 1930 variation in the binary
### boarding_schools>0 within states, so panel model makes no sense for binary outcome
### subset to start of period condition, then conditional on nonzero in 1900, look at count

#### LEANING TOWARD THE SCHOOL COUNT ONLY APPROACH. THE CAPACITY / ENROLLMENT NUMBERS NEED MORE WORK I THINK
### START HERE TOMORROW. FOLD THE REVISED NO LOG(KIDS) MODEL IN, FOLD THE ZINFL MODEL IN
